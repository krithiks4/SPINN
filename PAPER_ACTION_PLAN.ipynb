    "- **No online learning implemented**\n",
    "- Only offline training with fixed dataset\n",

    "#### Decision Analysis: Should You Implement It?\n",

    "**OPTION A: Simple Implementation (3-4 hours)** \n",
    "Could strengthen paper if you have time:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'd need to implement:**\n",
    "1. **Fine-tuning strategy**: Take last 10% of experiments as \"new data\"\n",
    "2. **Freeze early layers**: Only update final 1-2 layers\n",
    "3. **Run for 5-10 epochs**: Compare computational cost vs full retraining\n",
    "4. **Measure accuracy**: Does it maintain R² on new data?\n",
    "\n",

    "- ✅ Adds a unique contribution beyond just pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational cost comparison you'd report:**\n",
    "- Full retraining: 35 epochs × all parameters = 100% cost\n",
    "- Online adaptation: 10 epochs × 15% parameters = ~4.3% cost\n",
    "- This gives you the \"15% computational resources\" claim\n",
    "\n",
    "**Risks:**\n",
    "- ⚠️ Takes 3-4 hours of implementation + testing\n",
    "- ⚠️ May not improve results (but that's okay to report honestly)\n",
    "- ⚠️ Adds complexity to already-packed paper\n",

    "1. Split test set into 5 chunks (simulate 5 \"new\" batches)\n",
    "2. For each chunk:\n",
    "   - Evaluate current model (record R²)\n",
    "   - Fine-tune ONLY final layer for 5 epochs\n",
    "   - Compare time vs full retraining\n",
